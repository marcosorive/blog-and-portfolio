Hello! 😀

So, this is my new blog! I've restarted/revamped my blog so many times that I've lost a lot of content, but the process of rebuilding it with different technologies is very fun.
My last blog was made with Hugo, which is a great tool based in Golang. But I didn't invest enough time to learn Golang and Hugo, so the final result wasn't really good.  😥

## Enter Gatsby

After learning and using React for some time I discovered Gatsby and I immediately knew that it was the tool I needed. I used [gatsby paginted blog](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/gatsby-paginated-blog) as a starter and vanila CSS to build what you a seeing right now. You cand find the source code in [github](https://github.com/marcosorive/blog-and-portfolio). 

Oh, and it's deployed in Netlify using their CI/CD tools, which are amazingly fast and easy to use, you should try them! 🚀 🚀

## What am I going to write?

I honestly don't know. I have a few posts ideas in mind but the themes are very varied. From technology 💻 to my everyday life 🏃‍♂, food/cooking 🍕, maybe some music 🎸 related stuf... A little but of everthing really! 

Well, that's all for today see you next post. 👋
