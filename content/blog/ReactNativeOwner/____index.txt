[WIP][DRAFT]

Hi everyone!

This I was finishing my last project [Torky Native](https://github.com/marcosorive/torky-native) using React Native and Expo. And it was time to build the package. Oh boy I was ready to release it to the world, If only I knew what was coming for me.

Evertime I type 'expo build:android' I was getting a 401 error, which means I was unauthorized to use expo with my account. What??
